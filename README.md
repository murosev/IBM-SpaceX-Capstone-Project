# IBM-SpaceX-Capstone-Project

Final capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Program. 

This project is about using data science toolsets on a real-life problem. I have prepared my techniques and notebooks to demonstrate
my data science and research skills. I then prepare my findings in a PowerPoint presentation, which is placed in this repo.
